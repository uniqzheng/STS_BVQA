# Meeting minutes (ZQ:TZZ weekly)

### 10-16-2021, Mon

#### Done

- Finished reading three papers with respect to STS
- tried a little bit of visualization of VGG-16 feature maps

#### Todos
- Qi: use tightlayout in matplotlib and save figures when visualizing feature maps
- Qi: re-read STS papers and summarize different methods of slicing STS 
- Qi: throw videos to ResNet to gain feature maps and compute the MSCN empirical distributions


### 10-23-2021, Sat

#### Done

- Qi: use tightlayout in matplotlib and save figures when visualizing feature maps
- Qi: re-read STS papers and summarize different methods of slicing STS 

#### Todos
- Qi: conduct the experiment of the boost BIQA models using STS on Konvid, LIVE-VQC and YOUTUBE-UGC.
- Qi: improve complete blind QA models by fit KLD(p(natural), p(test)) where p() can be GMM, MVG and KDE (try on NIQE first).
- Qi: rewrite the cnn_visualizer_tf.ipynb in pytorch.
